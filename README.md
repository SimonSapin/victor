# Victor

Victor makes vectors.

This is a *toy* project for rendering vector-based things to PDF,
without rasterizing them or using an existing PDF library.

In his [Let's build a browser engine!] blog post series,
Matt Brubeck explains how toy projects are useful for learning
even if they take shortcuts and do many things wrong,
and goes through the making of Robinson, his toy HTML and CSS rendering engine.
My own experimentations with PDF in Rust began by [contributing to Robinson],
but since my goals aren’t necessarily the same I’ve moved to a separate project and repository.
