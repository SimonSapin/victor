# Lester

Lester, [Victor]’s cousin, makes raster graphics.

This is a reimplementation of [Poppler]’s `pdftocairo` utility program as a Rust library.
It loads PDF documents with Poppler
and renders (rasterizes) them to in-memory pixel buffers with [cairo].
It can then export to PNG.

Lester is primarily intended to help test the visual rendering of PDF files generated by Victor.
Reimplementing `pdftocairo` enables skipping the overhead of cross-process communication
and image compression/decompression.
It also enables extracting (and testing) PDF metadata at the same time as rendering.


## Requirements

* [Poppler], with its `glib` wrapper API.
* [cairo]
* [pkg-config], at build time

[Poppler]: https://poppler.freedesktop.org/
[cairo]: https://www.cairographics.org/
[pkg-config]: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/
