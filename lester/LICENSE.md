Lester dynamically links against the [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) library.
Poppler is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2.
See `LICENSE-GPLv2`.

It is unclear to the author whether this makes Lester a *derivative work* of Poppler,
and therefore makes Lester subject to the terms of the GPLv2.
Or whether distributing source code is different from distributing compiled binaries.
In doubt, the `license` key in Lesterâ€™s `Cargo.toml` file is set
to the SPDX License Expression `MIT AND GPL-2.0`.
