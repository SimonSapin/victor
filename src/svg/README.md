# SVG specification(s)

As of this writing (2016-05),
[https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/] is the Second Edition of SVG 1.1,
published as a W3C Recommendation on 2011-08-16.

The SVG Working Group is working on a draft of SVG 2: [https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/].
W3C’s /TR documents generally tend to be behind editor’s drafts in terms of bug fixes
so implementors tend to prefer reading the latter.
For SVG 2 however I’m less confident.
Its Status of This Document section explains a color code:

> Different coloring is also used to mark the maturity of different sections of the specification:
> * a red background indicates a section that is either unchanged since SVG 1.1
>   (and which therefore still requires review and possible rewriting for SVG 2),
>   or a section that is new but still requires substantial work

Unfortunately a lot of the draft is currently red,
so you may want to read both SVG 1.1 and SVG 2 and compare.
