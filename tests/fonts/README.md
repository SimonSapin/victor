## Noto

*Noto Sans Linear B* is part of the [Noto] font family.
It is distributed under OFL (see the `NotoSansLinearB-unhinted/LICENSE_OFL.txt` file).
It includes glyphs for Unicode code points above U+FFFF, outside the Basic Multilingual Plane.
These are represented differently in code point ⇔ glyph ID mappings,
and so require specific testing.
